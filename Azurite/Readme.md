Azurite
----------

The Azurite open-source emulator provides a free local environment for testing your Azure Blob, Queue Storage, and Table Storage applications. When you're satisfied with how your application is working locally, switch to using an Azure Storage account in the cloud. The emulator provides cross-platform support on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Azurite supersedes the Azure Storage Emulator, and continues to be updated to support the latest versions of Azure Storage APIs.
